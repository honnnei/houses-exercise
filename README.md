### How to run the app:

* yarn install / npm install
* yarn start / npm start
* yarn test / npm test

### Comments:
* I've had an issue with layout and responsiveness of the site - it's responsive but not really good for mobile yet.
* The 'Gallery' component does not display the images as perfect squares - would need to look into it more.
* In HouseDetails - used props instead of an api call (/houses/house_id) --> I thought it made more sense in this case.

### What I would do if I had more time:
* Implement perfect responsiveness and layout - especially for the mobile screen size.
* Implement nicer styling + add styling on the 'Offer' component.
* Add 80% + test coverage.
* Add error handling.
* Add validation to the Add House Form - all fields should be required etc.
